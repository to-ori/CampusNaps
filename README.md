This is the code used to create a website for an intro to Internet Programming module.
The company presented does not exist. The site is temporarily hosted on the NUIG Danu server, for the duration of the course. 
The website can be found at: http://danu6.it.nuigalway.ie/ToriHume11486248/assignment7/index.html until the student graduates.
